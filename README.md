This study consists of comparative study using the approach of literature review. The researcher did not use primary data as their main sources. Instead they collected the data from official documentation, systematically comparison and testing, and technically experimentation. The sources that is used in this study is systematically and carefully selected based on their credibility and accuracy. 


According to Softić and Vejzović's Examination of Windows 10, macOS, and Ubuntu. This study uses Common Vulnerability Scoring System. It's a way to evaluate and rank reported vulnerabilities in a standardized and repeatable way- it also uses numeric scoring from 1 (lowest vulnerability) to 10 (highest vulnerability) (Jonathan R., 2023). The three OSs' disclosed vulnerabilities are displayed(see Figure 2). Between 2015 and 2021. The total number of Windows 10 vulnerabilities have been rising since 2015. In contrast, Ubuntu's varied with time, falling in 2017 and reaching the highest peak in 2018 before falling even more to the three OS. On the other hand, the Figure 3 shows how the three OS maintained their performance overtime. The most preferred OS among the three operating system is macOS(1,972), followed by Windows 10(2,489), and Ubuntu(2,660).
