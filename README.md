This study consists of comparative study using the approach of literature review. The researcher did not use primary data as their main sources. Instead they collected the data from official documentation, systematically comparison and testing, and technically experimentation. The sources that is used in this study is systematically and carefully selected based on their credibility and accuracy. 


The study by Softić and Vejzović examines Windows 10, macOS, and Ubuntu using the Common Vulnerability Scoring System. The study found that Windows 10 has been experiencing a rise in vulnerabilities since 2015, while Ubuntu's number fluctuated over time. MacOS was the most preferred OS, followed by Windows 10 and Ubuntu. In Addition ,Lato, J., Mucha, M., & Szymczyk, T.'s study "Comparison of the most popular operating systems in terms of functionalities" states that Windows 10 provides more capability and compatibility for both regular users and businesses, whereas Ubuntu 20.04 is lighter, faster, and better suited for developers or advanced users familiar with Linux environments. Ubuntu excels at customization and setup simplicity, whereas Windows 10 provides a wider range of functionality. 

Lastly, The Comparative Study of Operating System Quality Attributes” by Odun‑Ayo et al. (2021) described Windows 10 excels in GUI, hardware compatibility, and system management but ranks low in security, preferred by only 2% for secure environments. In contrast, macOS X performs well in memory management, security, and overall architecture but struggles with hardware compatibility and system integration, also receiving only 2% user preference in these areas.
